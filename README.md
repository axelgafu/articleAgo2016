# Comparative Analysis of Phonetic Algorithms Applied to Spanish

## Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico

### Abstract
---
Natural language writing is a field of interest. Part of this process is related to
the written language. Something that is true about that is you can make mistakes
when writing or typing. Typographical errors are an example of those mistakes.
Those errors may be imperceptible to a human being, but still, harmless as they
may seem they may be sufficient to cause a failure when searching a record in
a database . Could a phonetic algorithm capture enough of the word sound
essence as to be considered a meaningful resource for colloquial Spanish?

**Keywords**: Natural Language Processing, Spanish, Phonetic algorithm

# Comparative Analysis of Phonetic Algorithms Applied to Spanish

## Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico

### Abstract
---
Text mining is a field of interest. It may use as input text written in natural language
for which is error prone. However, some of the typographical errors made while
typing may be imperceptible at a glance by a human being. In spite of that assumption,
they may be sufficient to cause a failure when using a computer to search a record in 
a database or maybe when processing natural language corpora. Efforts have been
done in the past to make some computer programs more robust against typographical 
errors. The present work discusses what a phonetic algorithm is and it proposes a 
precision measurement method for phonetic algorithms. It presents the results of 
applying the underlined method on text written in Spanish using natural language.

**Keywords**: Natural Language Processing, Spanish, Phonetic algorithm.

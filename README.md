# Comparative Analysis of Phonetic Algorithms Applied to Spanish

## Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico

### Abstract
---
The vast and ever-increasing text posting in "social networks" such as Facebook 
and Twitter, during the last 15 years, has produced an immense and rich text 
repository for several areas of knowledge. Therefore, text mining has recently 
become a very active and attractive area of research in computer science. The 
limited current understanding of the knowledge represented in these repositories 
has already influenced decision making for several companies, public figures 
and government agencies. However, the demand for full understanding and 
manipulation of these knowledge repositories has placed additional expectations 
on text mining. Hence, some algorithms have being developed for retrieving 
information, and most of them based on word recognition. This article discusses 
the use of phonetic algorithms to improve word recognition and proposes a 
precision measurement method to evaluate the results. It also presents some 
examples of applying some well-known phonetic algorithms on Spanish written 
texts using natural language processing techniques.

**Keywords**: Natural Language Processing; text processing; phonetic algorithms; 
Spanish text processing.
